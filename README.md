# Get My Cities

Created this as a place so that others are welcome to contribute with their own cities to this library. Ultimately making it a library with city names of most countries at our disposal whenever we need. Whats special here is that I aim to store city names in their own native characters as well as in English. 

## Status
Currently I have only added cities in following countries. But they are not fully completed I still need to work on them as well.
